Task:
Given a list of integers, try to sort it in non-decreasing order by doing only
the following operation as many number of times as you want: reverse the order
of any three consecutive integers in the list.
Find if it is possible to sort the given list in the above mentioned way and if
it is then also print the number of operations and list the operations in an
order applying which sorts the given list.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N, the number of
integers in the list. Second line contains the integers A[i] of the list.

Output:
For each test in the given order, print a string "YES" or "NO" in one line. If
the string is "YES" then also print (M+1) more lines (where M is the number of
operations you want to do). First of these lines contains M. Each of the next
M lines contains a space separated pair of 1-based indexes i and (i+2) which
indicates an operation reversing the order of A[i], A[i+1], A[i+2] in the list.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
2
4
2 3 1 1
6
2 5 5 1 5 5
Output (stdout):
YES
2
1 3
2 4
NO

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
3
1

3
6 6 6
Output (stdout):
YES

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- Correct and fast O(N^2) or better solution for full score.
