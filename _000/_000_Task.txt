Task:
Given two integers, find their sum.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two integers A and B in one line separated by a space.

Output:
For each test in the given order, print an integer C, then answer you are asked
to find in this task. Separate the answers by any whitespace character.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
1
2 3
Output (stdout):
5

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
3
4 5
6 -7
8 90
Output (stdout):
9 -1 98
Alternate Output (stdout):
9 -1
98

Scoring:
Batch   Score   Tests   Constraints
1       0.1     1       max(abs(A),abs(B))<=10
2       0.1     3       max(abs(A),abs(B))<=100
3       0.8     100000  max(abs(A),abs(B))<=1000000000

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 2s (java) or 2s (py) per batch.

Hints: Use fast input/output methods and solve each test in O(1) for batch-3.
