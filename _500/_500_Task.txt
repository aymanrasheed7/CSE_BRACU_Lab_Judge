Task:
Given the initial position (X, Y) in an N by N chessboard, find how many
distinct cells are reachable from the initial position within K Knight moves.
The rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by four integers N, K, X, Y in one line.

Output:
For each test in the given order, print the number of distinct reachable cells
which you are asked to find in this task in one line.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
2
3 3 1 2
3 0 1 1
Output (stdout):
7
1

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
2
10 1 8 4
1 1 1 1
Output (stdout):
9
1

Scoring:
Batch   Score   Tests   Constraints
1       0.1     2       1<=N<=5, 1<=X<=N, 1<=Y<=N, 0<=K<=5
2       0.1     2       1<=N<=10, 1<=X<=N, 1<=Y<=N, 0<=K<=10
3       0.2     20000   1<=N<=16, 1<=X<=N, 1<=Y<=N, 0<=K<=16
4       0.3     4       1<=N<=1000, 1<=X<=N, 1<=Y<=N, 0<=K<=1000
5       0.3     4       1<=N<=2000, 1<=X<=N, 1<=Y<=N, 0<=K<=2000

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
