Task:
Given the edges of a simple directed weighted graph with N nodes and M edges,
show the adjacency matrix representation of that graph.
The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by (M+1) lines. First line contains N and M. Each of the
remaining M lines contains U[i], V[i], W[i] indicating that there is an edge
from U[i] to V[i] with weight W[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print N lines each containing N integers,
representing the adjacency matrix which you are asked to prepare in this task.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
