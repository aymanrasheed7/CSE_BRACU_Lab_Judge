Task:
Given a list of integers, find if they are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N, the number of
integers in the list. Second line contains the integers A[i] of the list.

Output:
For each test in the given order, print a string "YES" or "NO" in one line.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
3
4
1 2 3 3
4
1 5 2 6
1
5
Output (stdout):
YES
NO
YES

Scoring:
Batch   Score   Tests   Constraints
1       0.2     3       1<=N<=4, 1<=A[i]<=10
2       0.2     10      1<=N<=10, 1<=A[i]<=1000
3       0.2     20      1<=N<=100, 1<=A[i]<=10000
4       0.2     50      1<=N<=1000, 1<=A[i]<=100000
5       0.2     100     1<=N<=10000, 1<=A[i]<=1000000

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- Correct and fast O(N*log(N)) or better solution for full score.
