Note,
- “TID” is the task ID (an underscore followed by 3 alphanumeric characters).
- “LNG” is the file extension of a programming language (cpp or java or py).
- “TID_Instruction.txt” contains user (students) instructions.

To test,
- You can write your solution in “Solution.LNG” and run “TID_Checker_LNG.bat” to check the solution. Try different solutions of different languages (within your scope) to see if the checker is working correctly and report anomalies to the developer.
- You can use “TID_Builder.bat” to create and view the student versions of the checker. “Template.LNG” is copied into “Solution.LNG” inside the student version. You are welcome to write a sample “Template.LNG” or “Solution.LNG” to the developer.
- You can use “TID_Cleaner.bat” to clean all the generated files (and the folder containing the student versions) for your convenience. It is automatically called when “TID_Builder.bat” is used.

To develop,
- Edit the functions prepareInput() and validateOutput() (and the global variables and helper functions before them) inside “TID.cpp”.
- Edit almost everything inside “TID_Task.txt”.
- If applicable for a problem then edit “TID_Forbidden.txt”.
