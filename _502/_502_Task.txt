Task:
Given a weighted unrooted tree with N nodes, find the length of the shortest
path from node 1 to node N. The length of a path is the sum of weights of the
edges in that path. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by N lines. First line contains N. Each of the next
(N-1) lines contains U[i], V[i], W[i] indicating that there is an edge between
U[i] and V[i] with weight W[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print one integer, the answer you are asked
to find in this task, in one line.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N) solution is expected.
