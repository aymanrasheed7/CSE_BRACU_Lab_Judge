Task:
Given a list of N distinct integers A[i] representing the in-order traversal of
some Binary Search Tree (BST), find the post-order traversal of any such BST of
the minimum height.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N. Second line
contains the integers A[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print any valid order of the integers which
you are asked to find in this task in one separate line.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
2
4
1 3 5 7
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output (stdout):
1 3 7 5
1 2 4 5 3

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
2
6
1 5 7 8 9 10
11
1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 66
Output (stdout):
1 7 5 9 10 8
1 3 10 15 6 28 36 55 66 45 21
Alternate Output (stdout):
1 5 8 10 9 7
1 3 10 15 6 28 36 55 66 45 21

Scoring:

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N*log(N)) solution is expected.
