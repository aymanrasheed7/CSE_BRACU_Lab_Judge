Task:
Given a list of integers, try to sort it (minimize the number of pairs of
integers which are in wrong order) in non-decreasing order by doing only the
following operation as many number of times as you want: swap two adjacent
integers with the same parity (both even or both odd).
Find the final state of the list where the above mentioned operation can not
decrease the number of pairs of integers which are in wrong order any further.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N, the number of
integers in the list. Second line contains the integers A[i] of the list.

Output:
For each test in the given order, print some space separated integers in the
same order of the list you are asked to find in this task in one separate line.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
1
14
4 8 2 9 1 5 4 6 8 1 7 13 11 8
Output (stdout):
2 4 8 1 5 9 4 6 8 1 7 11 13 8

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
3
7
4 2 4 7 1 6 1
5
3 5 9 7 1
1
221
Output (stdout):
2 4 4 1 7 6 1
1 3 5 7 9
221

Scoring:

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
